Here's a breakdown:
Memory Location: This is a specific spot in memory (RAM) where data is stored. Each memory location has an address (a number used to locate it), but in programming, you don’t usually interact with these memory addresses directly.
Variable (a and b): Variables like a and b are labels or identifiers that refer to memory locations where the data is actually stored.


Primitive Data Types and Memory Allocation:
When you declare let a = 5;, JavaScript assigns the value 5 to a specific memory location (say, location 1001), and a acts as a label for that memory address.
When you declare let b = a;, JavaScript creates a new memory location (e.g., 1002) and copies the value 5 from a into b. So, a and b refer to two different memory locations.

Immutability in Memory:
When you change the value of a to 10 (e.g., a = 10;), JavaScript does not modify the value at the original memory location (1001), but instead, it creates a new memory location (e.g., 1003) to store the new value 10.
Now, a points to the new memory location (1003) holding the value 10, while the old memory location (1001) still holds the original value 5.
Immutability means that the original value in memory doesn't change; rather, new memory locations are used for new values.
Memory Model for Primitive Types:

Copy code
Memory:
Location 1001: 5   (a does not points here now)
Location 1002: 5   (b points here; copy of the original value of a)
Location 1003: 10  (a now points here after reassignment)
Even though a no longer points to 1001, the value 5 at 1001 remains unchanged.
b still points to location 1002 and holds the value 5, unaffected by the reassignment of a.


 Garbage Collection:
JavaScript has automatic garbage collection mechanisms, which means it will eventually clean up memory that's no longer being referenced. When no variable refers to the old memory location (1001), the garbage collector will free up that space, preventing memory from being truly "wasted" over time.

In your example, after a points to the new location (1003), if there are no more references to the memory at 1001, garbage collection will eventually reclaim that space.

Summary:
Primitive data types are immutable because their values are copied into new memory locations upon reassignment.
Changing the value of a creates a new memory location, and the original value remains intact in memory, which illustrates the immutable nature of primitives.



For Non-Primitive Data Types (Objects, Arrays):
When you declare let obj1 = { value: 5 };, JavaScript creates an object in memory, and the variable obj1 holds a reference to the memory location of that object.
When you do let obj2 = obj1;, JavaScript copies the reference (not the actual object), so both obj1 and obj2 point to the same memory location.
Memory Model for Non-Primitive Types:
plaintext
Copy code
Memory:
Location 2001: { value: 5 }  (obj1 and obj2 both point here)
If you modify obj1.value = 10;:

plaintext
Copy code
Memory:
Location 2001: { value: 10 }  (both obj1 and obj2 reflect this change)
Here, obj1 and obj2 are both pointing to the same memory location, so a change in one affects the other.

Conclusion:
a and b are variables that hold values (for primitives) or references to memory locations (for non-primitives).
They are not memory places themselves but are pointers or references to memory locations where the actual data is stored.
For primitive types, a and b have separate memory locations with independent values.
For non-primitive types, a and b can point to the same memory location and thus share the same data.




                                    Analogy: Storage Boxes and Labels
Imagine you are in a large storage room, and you have empty boxes that represent memory spaces. The room manager (the computer) handles these boxes. Here's how it works:

Step 1: Declaring a Variable (let a)
You say to the room manager:

"I need a box, and I’ll call it a."
At this point, you haven’t told the manager what you’re going to store in the box yet, so the manager just acknowledges that you’ll need a box but doesn’t give it any specific size or content yet. The room manager makes a note that you’ve requested a box labeled a.

In technical terms:

The memory is reserved for the variable a, but no specific memory space is allocated for it because there's no value assigned yet.
Step 2: Assigning a Value (a = 10)
Now, you decide to put something in the box:

"I’m putting the number 10 in the box labeled a."
At this point, the room manager looks around for an appropriately-sized box that can hold the value 10. The box is labeled a, and the value 10 is stored inside it.

In technical terms:

The number 10 is allocated space in memory, and the variable a now points to that memory location.
So, here’s what happens in sequence:

The value 10 is created in memory first, and the computer finds a memory space to store this number.
The variable a is then linked to the memory location where 10 is stored, effectively labeling that memory spot.
Step 3: Reassigning a New Value (a = 20)
Later on, you want to change what’s inside the box:

"Now, I’m putting the number 20 in the box labeled a."
Again, the room manager doesn’t modify the box holding 10. Instead, it finds another box to hold 20. Now, a is relabeled to point to the new box holding 20, while the old box with 10 is still there, but unused.

In technical terms:

When you change a = 20, a new memory space is allocated for 20, and a is updated to point to the new location.
The old memory spot with 10 is left untouched and may eventually be cleaned up (by the garbage collector).
What Happens First?
To answer your specific question:

First, the memory space is given to the value (10), and the value is stored in memory.
Then, the label (a) is linked to that memory space.
The computer always assigns the memory first to store the value, then associates the variable name with the memory address where that value resides. This is because the memory needs to store something before the variable can reference it.

Summary of the Analogy:
Declaring a variable is like telling the room manager (computer) that you’ll need a box but not filling it yet.
Assigning a value is like deciding what to put in the box. The manager finds a suitable box to store it and labels that box with your chosen name (e.g., a).
Reassigning a value makes the manager find a new box for the new value, and the label a is moved to the new box, leaving the old box unused.
This helps visualize how memory and variables work together for primitive data types in JavaScript
