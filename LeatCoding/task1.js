//Explanation:
// The logic behind using `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` in the computation of the result array (`answer`) without division in the problem of finding the product of all elements except the current one (from the `nums` array) stems from the need to isolate each element's influence on the product. The approach splits the product calculation into two phases that cumulatively ensure every `answer[i]` contains the product of every number in `nums` except `nums[i]`. Hereâ€™s why each is necessary and how they logically contribute to the solution:

// ### Conceptual Overview

// **Fundamental Challenge**: You need to calculate the product of all elements except the current one for each position in the array. If you were allowed to use division, you could simply calculate the product of all numbers once and then divide by the current number at each index. However, without division, you must find another way to exclude the current number from the product.

// ### Why `leftProduct` and `rightProduct`?

// 1. **`leftProduct` (Product of All Elements to the Left)**
//    - For any given index `i`, `leftProduct` captures the product of all elements that are positioned to the left of `i` in the array.
//    - This ensures that when calculating `answer[i]`, the product doesn't include `nums[i]` itself or any elements to its right (initially).
//    - **Example**: For an array `nums = [a, b, c, d]`, when computing `answer[2]` for element `c`, `leftProduct` at index 2 will be `a*b`.

// 2. **`rightProduct` (Product of All Elements to the Right)**
//    - For the same index `i`, `rightProduct` accumulates the product of all elements to the right of `i`.
//    - It complements `leftProduct` by ensuring that the product for `answer[i]` also includes all elements after `i` but not `i` itself.
//    - **Example**: Continuing from above, `rightProduct` for index 2 will capture the product of elements after `c`, which is `d`. 

// ### How They Work Together

// - **Combining Effects**: For each index `i`, combining `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` gives the total product of all array elements except `nums[i]`. In essence, `answer[i] = leftProduct[i] * rightProduct[i]` provides a seamless way to achieve the desired result by breaking down the problem into two simpler subproblems:
//   - Compute the product of elements before the current index.
//   - Compute the product of elements after the current index.
// - **Iterative Computation**: Each of `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` can be computed in a single pass of the array:
//   - The first pass (from left to right) calculates and stores cumulative products in `leftProduct` or directly in `answer`.
//   - The second pass (from right to left) multiplies each entry by the right-side products computed on-the-fly.

// ### Final Thoughts

// Using `leftProduct` and `rightProduct` effectively decomposes the complex task of excluding a specific element into manageable parts, addressing it through cumulative multiplication. This approach adheres to the constraint of not using division and ensures a linear time complexity, while intuitively matching how you might manually calculate such products by segmenting the array around each element.
