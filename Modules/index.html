<!-- as the HTML page is loaded the JS file in the script tag are executed automatically , the order does not matter if its type is module otherwise the order of JS script files are really important  -->
<script  type="module" src="./amazon.js"></script>
<!-- <script type="module" src="./product.js"></script> you can just remove the script tag from and load products variable array in to the amazon.js file from importing it from product.js , so we will mainly have 1 script JS file per html page , the rest of the JS file will be available but not in the html page , we will just import and export codes from there to the desire file  -->
